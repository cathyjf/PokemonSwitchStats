# Pok&eacute;mon Switching Statistics

This is a program that reads [Shoddy Battle][] battle logs in order to prepare
statistics regarding Pok&eacute;mon switching. This program was written by
[Cathy Fitzpatrick][cathyjf] in September 2009 and it is licensed under the
[GNU Affero General Public License][agpl3], version 3 or later.

The `logs` directory contains several sample logs to run the program on.

## Definitions

In order to understand the statistics, it is necessary to define some terms.

Except for at the start of the battle, whenever one player sends out a new
Pokémon X (including through Baton Pass and U-turn), if there is a Pokémon Y on
the opponent's side of the field, then we say that Pokémon X _switched into_
Pokémon Y. We call Pokémon X the **subject** of the switch in and Pokémon Y the
**object** of the switch in.

We can sort the switch in statistics both _by subject_ and _by object_. Given a
particular Pokémon X, the statistics sorted _by subject_ tell you the most
common Pokémon that Pokémon X **switches into**. Similarly, given a particular
Pokémon X, the statistics sorted _by object_ tell you the most common Pokémon
who **switch into** Pokémon X.

### Interpretation example

Here is an example of how to interpret this data. This is an excerpt from the
statistics sorted by subject showing you the most common Pokémon that Gyarados
switches into on the Standard ladder:

1. Scizor - 7.12% (12166)
2. Heatran - 6.37% (10897)
3. Swampert - 4.85% (8284)
4. Infernape - 4.62% (7907)
5. Salamence - 3.86% (6597)
6. Gyarados - 3.7% (6321)
7. Lucario - 3.34% (5715)

This means that in August 2009, Gyarados switched into Scizor 12166 times,
which was 7.12% of all switches in which Gyarados was the subject.

## August 2009 data

This program was run on the battle logs from Smogon's Shoddy Battle server for
August 2009. Here are the results as generated by this program:
